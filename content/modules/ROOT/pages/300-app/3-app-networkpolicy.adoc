== Introduction

NetworkPolicies are used to control and secure communication between pods within a cluster. They provide a declarative approach to define and enforce network traffic rules, allowing you to specify the desired network behavior. By using NetworkPolicies, you can enhance the overall security of your applications by isolating and segmenting different components within the cluster. These policies enable fine-grained control over network access, allowing you to define ingress and egress rules based on criteria such as IP addresses, ports, and pod selectors.

For this module we will be applying networkpolices to the previously created 'microsweeper-ex' namespace and using the 'microsweeper' app to test these policies. In addition, we will deploy two new applications to test against the 'microsweeper' app.

== Applying Network Policies

. First, let's create a new project for us to deploy a new test application. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
 oc new-project networkpolicy-test
----
+
.  Next, we will create a new application that will allow us to test connectivity to the microsweeper application. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
 cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Pod
 metadata:
   name: networkpolicy-pod
   namespace: networkpolicy-test
   labels:
     app: networkpolicy
 spec:
   securityContext:
     allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
   containers:
     - name: networkpolicy-pod
       image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal
       command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
EOF
----
+
. Now we will change to the microsweeper-ex project to start applying the network policies
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
 oc project microsweeper-ex
----
+
. Fetch the IP address of the `microsweeper` Pod
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
MS_IP=$(oc -n microsweeper-ex get pod -l \
  "app.kubernetes.io/name=microsweeper-appservice" \
  -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.podIP}")
echo $MS_IP
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
10.128.2.242
----

. Now, let's validate that the `networkpolicy-pod` can access the `microsweeper` pod. By default, ARO does not implement any NetworkPolicy, so we should be able to easily verify that we can access the microsweeper application. To test this, let's run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n networkpolicy-test exec -ti pod/networkpolicy-pod -- curl $MS_IP:8080 | head
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
    <script
            src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"
----

. While ARO doesn't block inter-project pod traffic by default, it is a common use case to not allow pods to cross communicate between projects (namespaces). This can be done by a fairly simple NetworkPolicy.
+
[INFO]
====
This Network Policy will restrict ingress to the pods in the project `microsweeper-ex` to only allow traffic from the OpenShift IngressController and only on port 8080.
====
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
  namespace: microsweeper-ex
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-from-openshift-ingress created
----

. Now that we've implemented that NetworkPolicy, let's try to access the `microsweeper` pod from the `networkpolicy-pod` pod again. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n networkpolicy-test exec -ti pod/networkpolicy-pod -- curl $MS_IP:8080 | head
----
+
This time it should fail to connect - it will just sit there.
Hit Ctrl-C to avoid having to wait until a timeout.
+
[TIP]
====
If you have your browser still open to the microsweeper app, you can refresh and see that you can still access it.
====

. In other cases, you may want to allow your application to be accessible to only _certain_ namespaces. In this example, lets allow access to just your `microsweeper` application from only the `networkpolicy-pod` in the `networkpolicy-test` namespace using a label selector. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-networkpolicy-pod-ap
  namespace: microsweeper-ex
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: microsweeper-appservice
  ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: networkpolicy-test
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: networkpolicy
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-networkpolicy-pod-ap created
----

. Now, let's check to see if `networkpolicy-pod` can access the pod. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n networkpolicy-test exec -ti pod/networkpolicy-pod -- curl $MS_IP:8080 | head
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
    <script
            src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"
----

. Now, let's try a different pod (with a different label) in the `networkpolicy-test` namespace. Let's create a new pod called `new-test`. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: new-test
  namespace: networkpolicy-test
  labels:
    app: new-test
spec:
  securityContext:
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  containers:
    - name: new-test
      image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal
      command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
EOF
----
+
. Now, let's try to curl the `microsweeper` application by running the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n networkpolicy-test exec -ti pod/new-test -- curl $MS_IP:8080 | head
----
+
This will fail with a timeout again.
Hit Ctrl-C to avoid waiting for a timeout.

== Summary

Here you learned:

* Network Policies are a powerful way to apply zero-trust networking patterns.
* Access to pods can be restricted to other Pods, Namespaces, or other labels.
* Access can be completely denied, allowed, or set to particular ports or services.
