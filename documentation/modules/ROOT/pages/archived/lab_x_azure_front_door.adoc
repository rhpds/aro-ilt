= Using Azure Front Door for Application Ingress

Up to this point, we have deployed the microsweeper app using the publicly available ingress controller that comes with our public Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

Now, we will continue our work to expose our application via Azure Front Door using the private ingress controller that we created earlier in the workshop.

A quick diagram of the ARO and Azure Front Door integration:

There are several advantages of this approach:

* The ARO cluster and all the resources in your Azure account can be private.
* Azure Front Door operates at the edge so we are controlling traffic before it gets into your Azure account.
* Azure Front Door offers WAF and DDoS protection, certificate management, and SSL offloading, as well as many other security and performance related features.

As you can see in the diagram, Azure Front Door sits on the edge of the Microsoft network and is connected to the cluster via an Azure Private Link service.

. First, let's verify that the ingress controller we created earlier in the workshop is still there.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get IngressController private -n openshift-ingress-operator -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq
----
+
.You'll see a lot of output, but the main thing you're looking for is that the deployment is available:
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
 [...]
   {
     "lastTransitionTime": "2022-11-15T04:02:05Z",
     "message": "The deployment has Available status condition set to True",
     "reason": "DeploymentAvailable",
     "status": "True",
     "type": "DeploymentAvailable"
   },
 [...]
----

. Since we've already configured Azure Front Door with a custom domain, we just need to tell OpenShift to expect traffic to come from our custom domain via a route.
To create our route, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: microsweeper-appservice
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    app.openshift.io/runtime: quarkus
    type: private
  name: microsweeper-appservice-fd
  namespace: microsweeper-ex
spec:
  host: app.${AZ_USER}.ws.mobb.cloud
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: microsweeper-appservice
    weight: 100
    targetPort:
      port: 8080
  wildcardPolicy: None
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----

----

. Now, we're ready to validate our Azure Front Door endpoint.
To do so, we need to get the custom domain to use.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex get route microsweeper-appservice-fd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----

----

. Then visit the URL presented in a new tab in your web browser (using HTTPS). Notice that the application is secured! This is done automatically for us by Front Door.

. If you remember, one of the benefits of using Azure Front Door is that traffic is sent through and secured at the Microsoft edge, rather than your application. You can get some idea of how the traffic flows by looking at how the DNS for the custom domain is resolving:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
nslookup app.${AZ_USER}.ws.mobb.cloud
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----

Address:        168.63.129.16#53

Non-authoritative answer:
app.user1.ws.mobb.cloud canonical name = user1-ilb-3686-fqchgscue9gqb7hq.z01.azurefd.net.
user1-ilb-3686-fqchgscue9gqb7hq.z01.azurefd.net canonical name = star-azurefd-prod.trafficmanager.net.
star-azurefd-prod.trafficmanager.net    canonical name = dual.part-0029.t-0009.t-msedge.net.
dual.part-0029.t-0009.t-msedge.net      canonical name = part-0029.t-0009.t-msedge.net.

Notice how the results show traffic coming from `*.t-msedge.net`.

Congratulations!
You have now deployed a custom application, and exposed it to the internet using Azure Front Door.
