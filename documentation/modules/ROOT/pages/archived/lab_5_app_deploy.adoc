= Deploy a Go Microservices Application

Now that you have your environment provisioned and the prerequisites fulfilled, it is time to start working on the labs.

== Application Overview

You will be deploying a ratings application on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

image::media/app-overview.png[Application diagram,width=100%]

The application consists of 3 components:

|===
| Component | Link

| A public facing API `rating-api`
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api[GitHub repo]

| A public facing web frontend `rating-web`
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web[GitHub repo]

| A MongoDB with pre-loaded data
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api/raw/master/data.tar.gz[Data]
|===

Once you're done, you'll have an experience similar to the below.

image:media/app-overview-2.png[Application]

image:media/app-overview-3.png[Application]

== Create Project

A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities.
A project has a 1-to-1 mapping with a standard Kubernetes namespace.

. Create a project called `workshop`:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project workshop
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "workshop" on server "https://api.gqfnl2xz.eastus.aroapp.io:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname

== Deploy MongoDB from DockerHub image

Azure Red Hat OpenShift allows you to deploy a container image from Docker hub easily and we will deploy a MongoDB database service this way.
The mandatory environment variables (user, password, database name etc.) can be passed in the `oc new-app` command line

. Deploy the MongoDB database:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-app bitnami/mongodb \
  -e MONGODB_USERNAME=ratingsuser \
  -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=ratingspassword \
  -e MONGODB_DATABASE=ratingsdb \
  -e MONGODB_ROOT_USER=root \
  -e MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=ratingspassword
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
--> Found container image f426934 (2 days old) from Docker Hub for "bitnami/mongodb"

    * An image stream tag will be created as "mongodb:latest" that will track this image

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "mongodb" created
    deployment.apps "mongodb" created
    service "mongodb" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/mongodb'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

. Head back to the OpenShift web console.
+
If you don't see the Developer perspective click on the *Administrator* link under the OpenShift logo and select *Developer*, then if applicable click *Skip Tour* and select your `workshop` project from the *Project* drop down.
. Then click *Topology* to see the application layout.

=== Verify if the mongoDB pod was created successfully

Run the `oc get all` command to view the status of the new application and verify if the deployment of the mongoDB template was successful.

. Display all resources in the `workshop` project:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get all
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]

=== Retrieve mongoDB service hostname

. Find the mongoDB service.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get svc mongodb
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
mongodb   ClusterIP   172.30.170.239   <none>        27017/TCP   5m20s
----
+
The service will be accessible at the following DNS name: `mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`.
This resolves only within the cluster.

. You can also retrieve this from the web console (click on the *mongodb* deployment, then under *Services* click on the *mongodb* service). You'll need this hostname to configure the `rating-api`.

image::media/mongo-svc-webconsole.png[MongoDB service in the Web Console]

== Deploy Ratings API

The `rating-api` is a NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB to retrieve and rate items.
Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

* `rating-api` on Gitea migrated from: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api
* The container exposes port 8080
* MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI`
* You're going to be using <<source-to-image-s2i,source-to-image (S2I)>> as a build strategy.

. Set an environment variable for your personal Gitea instance URL:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
export GITEA_URL=$(oc get route gitea -n gitea -o json | jq -r .spec.host); echo $GITEA_URL
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
gitea-gitea.apps.gqfnl2xz.eastus.aroapp.io
----

. Create the new application from git source
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-app https://${GITEA_URL}/developer/ratings-api --strategy=source --name=rating-api -n workshop
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
--> Found image 3e4c7d3 (2 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/nodejs" under tag "16-ubi8" for "nodejs"

    Node.js 16
    ----------
    Node.js 16 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Node.js 16 applications and frameworks. Node.js is a p
latform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking
 I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

    Tags: builder, nodejs, nodejs16

    * The source repository appears to match: nodejs
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "rating-api:latest"
      * Use 'oc start-build' to trigger a new build

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "rating-api" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "rating-api" created
    deployment.apps "rating-api" created
    service "rating-api" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f buildconfig/rating-api' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/rating-api'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

=== Configure the required environment variables

Create the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.

This URI should look like `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`.
You'll need to replace the `[username]` and `[password]` with the ones you used when creating the database.
You'll also need to replace the `[endpoint]` with the hostname acquired in the previous step

. Set the environment variable for the `Deployment` called *rating-api*:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc set env deploy/rating-api MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment.apps/rating-api updated
----

=== Verify that the service is running

If you check the logs of and pod managed by the `rating-api` deployment, you should see a log message confirming the code can successfully connect to the mongoDB.

. Check that your pods have a log message confirming that the application can connect to the database:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc logs deploy/rating-api | grep CONNECTED
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
'CONNECTED TO mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb'
----

=== Retrieve `rating-api` service hostname

. Find the `rating-api` service.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get svc rating-api
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
rating-api   ClusterIP   172.30.58.112   <none>        8080/TCP   8m58s
----

The service will be accessible at the following DNS name over port 8080: `rating-api.workshop.svc.cluster.local:8080` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`. This resolves only within the cluster.

== Deploy Ratings frontend

The `rating-web` is a NodeJS application that connects to the `rating-api`.
Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

* `rating-web` on Gitea migrated from https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web
* The rating-web frontend Dockerfile needs modification to the image to run on ARO 4.x versions
* The container exposes port 8080
* The web app connects to the API over the internal cluster DNS, using a proxy through an environment variable named `API`

=== Modify Dockerfile in your repository

____
*Note* The Dockerfile needs to be modified to use the correct node.js image to build correctly.
____

. Clone the Git repository locally and change to repo directory:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----

WK need to udpate Gitea to allow webhook calls...
=== Setup Gitea webhook

To trigger S2I builds when you push code into your source code repository, you'll need to setup a webhook.

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger secret. You'll need use this secret in the GitHub webhook URL.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get bc/rating-web -o=jsonpath='{.spec.triggers..github.secret}'; echo
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
W0Xu-5FgaFgGOXmJOJHb
----

You'll get back something similar to the below.
Make note the secret key in the red box as you'll need it in a few steps.

image::media/rating-web-github-secret.png[Rating Web GitHub trigger secret]

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger URL from the build configuration.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc describe bc/rating-web | grep URL | grep github | awk -c '{print $2}'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
https://api.gqfnl2xz.eastus.aroapp.io:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/workshop/buildconfigs/rating-web/webhooks/<secret>/github
----
+
You will need to replace the `<secret>` placeholder with the secret you retrieved in the previous step. You'll use this URL to setup the webhook on your source code repository.

. Remind yourself of your Gitea repository URL:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo https://$GITEA_URL
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
https://gitea-gitea.apps.gqfnl2xz.eastus.aroapp.io
----

. Use this URL in another browser window to open the Gitea repository.
. Sign into Gitea by clicking the *Sign In* link on the top right of the page.
. Use `developer` as the username and `%generated_password%` as the password.
. In the list of repositories click on the repository *developer/ratings-web*.
. In the repository click on *Settings* then on *Webhooks*.
. Click the blue *Add Webhook* button and select *Gitea* for the webhook type.
. Add the URL that you constructed before (e.g. `https://api.gqfnl2xz.eastus.aroapp.io:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/workshop/buildconfigs/rating-web/webhooks/<secret>/github` - with `<secret>` replaced with your personal secret.)
. Click *Add webhook*.
+
image::media/gitea-webhook.png[Gitea add webhook]

Now, whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build will automatically start, and upon a successful build a new deployment will start.

=== Make a change to the website app and see the rolling update

. In your Gitea repository navigate to the file `/src/App.vue`.
. Edit the file, and change the `background-color: #999;` line to be `background-color: #0071c5`.
. Commit the changes to the file into the `master` branch.
. Immediately, go to the *Builds* tab in the OpenShift Web Console. You'll see a new build queued up which was triggered by the push. Once this is done, it will trigger a new deployment and you should see the new website color updated.

== Create Network Policy

Now that you have the application working, it is time to apply some security hardening.

You'll use https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.html[network policies] to restrict communication to the `rating-api`.

=== Switch to the OpenShift Administrative Console

. In the OpenShift Web Console switch back to the Administrator console (top left, click on *Developer* and select *Administrator*).

. On the left expand *Networking* and click *NetworkPolicies*.
. If it is not already selected select *workshop* from the dropdown list of *Projects*.
. Create a new NetworkPolicy with the following properties:
* You will create a policy that applies to any pod matching the `app=rating-api` label.
* The policy will allow ingress only from pods matching the `app=rating-web` label.
+
Click the blue *Create Network Policy* button.
. Click the `YAML view` radio button.
. Paste the YAML below in the editor overwriting the default YAML that has been pre-populated.
+
[source,yaml,role=copy]
